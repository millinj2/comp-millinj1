Apple’s past week was supposed to be triumphant.
And although Apple is expected to gain ground in the smartphone market this year, it’s still far behind its chief competitor Samsung in terms of shipments.
According to a report this week from IHS Markit, Apple pays $216 to bundle a single HomePod unit.
Samsung is forecast to capture 20.3% of the smartphone market by the end of the year.
Speaking of 2018, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said this week that Apple is expected to ship three new iPhones this year.
