AppleI really thought we'd see a shorter beta window this time around so that Apple could release iOS 11.3 early in March, but I was wrong.
Instead, we're getting the fourth round of Public Beta releases today, with a fifth and possible sixth seed later in the month.
Those will likely be quick-turnaround weekend releases like we saw with iOS 11.2 and iOS 11.1 as we near the end-of-March release date for iOS 11.3.
What's Fixed in Public Beta 4If you'd been having issues with your Mac not recognizing an iDevice running the iOS 11.3 beta, that will be resolved with this update.
If things progress as they have previously, we'll see Public Beta 5 next Tuesday, with Public Beta 6 posting the following weekend.e following weekend.
