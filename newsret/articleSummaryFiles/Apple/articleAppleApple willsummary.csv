The notices refer customers to the retail section of Apple's website to buy products, or to find the nearest store.The current store listing for Apple Bluewater notes it is currently closed, but indicates the nearest physical outlet to that location is Apple Bromley, approximately 14 miles away.The Bluewater store was the third opened by Apple in the United Kingdom, launched in 2005 following after Regent Street and Birmingham, and is the first UK Apple Store to open in a mall.
Apple closed the store on July 30 last year for renovations, part of the firm's ongoing program to refurbish its outlets with updated fixtures and fittings.While it is unknown exactly how the new store will look, the recent reopening of the Crabtree Valley Mall store in Raleigh, N.C. in December shows what to expect from Apple's next-generation "town square" design language.uage.
