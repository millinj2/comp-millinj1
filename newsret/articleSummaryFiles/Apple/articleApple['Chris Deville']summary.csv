Pretty great ever since we heard there’s a new Courtney Barnett album coming out!
While we wait for more new original songs, Barnett has shared a new cover from fellow Australian legends INXS, whose 1987 classic Kick she once performed in full.
Now she’s given the studio treatment to one of that album’s hit singles, “Never Tear Us Apart,” for an Apple commercial in support of marriage equality.
As Tone Deaf points out, she recorded the cover specifically for this ad, which was shot using iPhone X.
In the meantime, please enjoy one minute of Courtney Barnett x INXS magic set to moving pictures of an especially moving variety.especially moving variety.
