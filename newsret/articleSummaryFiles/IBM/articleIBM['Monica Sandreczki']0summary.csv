BINGHAMTON, NY (WSKG) – Thursday night was an incremental step in the decontamination process of the old IBM campus that’s expected to take years.
The state presented a proposed method to do the final clean up at a building that’s much less contaminated than some of the others.
Some were concerned if the air was contaminated or if the clean up underground was leading to sinkholes higher up.
However, this OU7 site is much less contaminated than a couple of other sites, OU1 and OU2.
They call those “Ground Zero.” The DEC expects to have have a list of possible remedies for ground zero near the end of the year.year.
