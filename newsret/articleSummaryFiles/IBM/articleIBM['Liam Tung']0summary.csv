The service, dubbed PAIRS Geoscope, is available for developers to use IBM's REST API for the service to add geospatial and time-based data to their own apps.
PAIRS is supposed to take the "dirty work" out of data acquisition and searches for insights across multiple data sources in multiple data formats.
PAIRS users can also upload proprietary data to combine with existing data layers, for example, to combine IoT sensor data.
