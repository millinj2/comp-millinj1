"We built the POWER9 CPU from the ground-up with the most data-intensive workloads in mind," said IBM VP and Fellow Brad McCredie.
"PCIe Gen4 devices are critical components to driving performance across the system stack, and with POWER9 their full potential can be realized."
"We are excited to incorporate Eideticom's storage acceleration and PCIe Gen4 technology in our Barreleye G2 server," said Adi Gangidi, system design engineer at Rackspace.
"Leveraging leading standards based interfaces including NVM Express and PCIe Gen4 allows application developers to rapidly deploy new solutions into the market."
"OpenPOWER has already demonstrated PCIe Gen4 support with IBM, Mellanox, and Xilinx and we are delighted that Eideticom can now offer fast storage and compute via NVMe over that PCIe Gen4 ecosystem."
