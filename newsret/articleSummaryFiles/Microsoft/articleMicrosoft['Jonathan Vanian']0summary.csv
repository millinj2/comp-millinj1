Microsoft is celebrating Pi Day—a nerdy celebration of math held annually on March 14—by cutting the price of some laptops sold on its online store by 31.4%.
The technology giant joins other companies like Whole Foods and Boston Market that are using Pi Day as a promotional event to sell products at discounted prices.
This year marks the 30th anniversary of Pi Day, which celebrate mathematics through the recognition of the first three digits of Pi, the mathematical constant that’s fundamental to understanding geometry and related number crunching.
Some of the deals available on the Microsoft Store include a Dell XPS 13 Laptop that costs $1,099 instead of $1,399.
An Alienware 17 R4 laptop now costs $1,499 instead of $1,699, while an HP Inc. (hpq) Spectre laptop costs $1,099 instead of $1,249.9 instead of $1,249.
