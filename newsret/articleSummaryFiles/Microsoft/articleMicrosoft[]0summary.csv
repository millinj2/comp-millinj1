Microsoft’s Tuesday patch-fest may have reacted quite negatively with Windows Server 2008 R2 running VMware, leaving servers offline and administrators scrambling to recover IP addresses.
Twitter user @Sikorsky78 noted the problem just after the patches hit:It seems that the latest MS patches ate my vmxnet3 adapters on Windows 2008R2 :(.
Microsoft has remained tightlipped on the issue, leaving it to users to work out what part of the update borked their carefully crafted networks.
The issue appears isolated to Windows Server 2008 R2 installations, with those running VMware VMs particularly hard hit.
In the meantime, probably best to think very carefully before allowing these patches anywhere near a production environment, m’kay?nvironment, m’kay?
