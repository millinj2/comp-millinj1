All users who have been forced to upgrade to Windows 10 version 1709 seem to have limited the Diagnostic Data that could be collected by Microsoft.
As reported by Windows blog AskWoody, Windows 10 users on versions 1607 and 1703 were pushed into the update, even if they had Feature Updates deferred.
Version 1607 is also known as the Anniversary Update, and version 1703 is called the First Spring Creators Update of Windows 10.
By deferring feature updates, Windows users can push back certain updates for quite a long time, placing them on a path called "Current Branch for Business."
The forced update also might have something to do with this update not going through Windows Update, therefore not following the determined deferral settings.ings.
