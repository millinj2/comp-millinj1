Last month, a permanent division between the staff seemed imminent, as committee Republicans, led by Chairman Devin Nunes, R-California, put forth plans to construct a physical barrier to separate the staff by party.
"It was an ill-conceived idea that would have forever changed the character of the committee," said the official.
"We only heard indirectly that there was a proposal by the chairman to build a wall dividing our staffs," said Ranking Member Adam Schiff, D-California.
"But as they didn't tell us they were planning to build it, they haven't told us they've abandoned the plan, either," Schiff said.
Some Republicans on the committee have similarly denied knowing much about the status of plans for the wall.wall.
