This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system.
Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month.
A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return.
Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations.
Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.ions.
