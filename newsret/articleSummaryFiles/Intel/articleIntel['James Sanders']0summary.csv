Here are the big takeaways:The SgxPectre vulnerability exposes the contents of secure enclaves used in 6th generation and newer Intel processors.
While the original Spectre vulnerability relied on branch prediction and speculation to read kernel-level memory, it was not able to read the contents of SGX-protected secure enclaves.
Because the problems exist in the runtime libraries, any program utilizing SGX is insecure, independent of how SGX utilization is implemented in the program.
According to the researchers: "The branch prediction units used in the enclave mode for predicting branch targets are not thoroughly cleansed upon enclave entrance.
Therefore, code outside the targeted enclave (either running in the unprotected memory region or in another enclave) can manipulate the targets the branch prediction inside the targeted enclave."ave."
