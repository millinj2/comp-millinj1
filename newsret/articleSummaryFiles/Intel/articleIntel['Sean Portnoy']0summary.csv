It's been less than six months since ZDNet reviewed the Lenovo Yoga 720, the then-latest version of its popular convertible laptop.
But as highly thought of as that hybrid was, Lenovo is already back at MWC with an upgraded version.
Predictably dubbed the Yoga 730 series, the new notebooks include a couple of notable updates for 2018.
As with its 720 predecessor, the Yoga 730 comes in 13-inch and 15-inch sizes, with pricing starting around $880 and $900, respectively, when they become available in April.
For those who can live without the niceties of the Yoga 730, the refreshed Flex 14 will also be available in April for a starting price around $600.$600.
