Microsoft does have some ideas for the kinds of performance hits we should expect on PCs, and its work suggests any performance changes will be CPU-dependent and operating-system-dependent.
It's important to remember that the microcode updates Intel is issuing are mitigations, not curatives.
JavaScriptFirst off, we have several synthetic JavaScript benchmarks that give us a good idea of single-threaded performance changes.
On the whole, a geometric mean of the performance changes we saw suggests a 6.1% loss in these benchmarks.arks.
