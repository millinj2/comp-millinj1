As of re:Invent 2017, Amazon Web Services (AWS) loves Kubernetes and is officially "all in" on the open source container orchestration project.
Given that 63% of Kubernetes cloud workloads already run on AWS, coupled with AWS's stated goal of enabling maximum developer choice, it was perhaps a foregone conclusion that AWS would roll out Amazon Elastic Compute Service for Kubernetes (EKS), a managed Kubernetes service to rival those already offered by Microsoft and Google.
They are in the process of creating a service that will take the pain out of cluster management and integrate it with their managed Kubernetes service.
And with Amazon Fargate, this hits overdrive.
But so is AWS, and AWS commands much more developer fealty than Kubernetes does (impressive as Kubernetes' community is). is).
