More than 29 million Americans have diabetes, and are at risk for diabetic retinopathy, a potentially blinding eye disease.
But as it progresses, diabetic retinopathy usually causes vision loss that in many cases cannot be reversed.
In earlier research, Dr. Peng and her team used neural networks—complex mathematical systems for identifying patterns in data—to recognize diabetic retinopathy.
But Dr. Peng is interested in developing a system that would be good enough for her grandmother.
Using these specialist-graded images, Dr. Peng could then fine-tune the software, which improved their model’s performance and improved detection of disease.ease.
