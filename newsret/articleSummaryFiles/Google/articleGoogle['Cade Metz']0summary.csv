PhotoSAN FRANCISCO â€” Machines are starting to learn tasks on their own.
They are identifying faces, recognizing spoken words, reading medical scans and even carrying on their own conversations.
PhotoAll this is done through so-called neural networks, which are complex computer algorithms that learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data.
But these neural networks create a problem that scientists are trying to solve: It is not always easy to tell how the machines arrive at their conclusions.
researchers are now developing ways to better understand neural networks.and neural networks.
